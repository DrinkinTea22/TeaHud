# TeaHud
a HUD for TF2

1. Select your current screen resolution in "TeaHud/Customization/" otherwise SpectatorTournament will not work properly.
2. Customizations:
-Last Damage Done + SpectatorTournament hud.
3. To change some colors, go to "TeaHud/Resource/Clientscheme" and there you have a template with some colors.
